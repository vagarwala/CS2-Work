freq.py contains the function freq(s) which takes in a string and returns an array of the frequencies of each letter in the string.

to run the program:
>>> python freq.py
then type the string to be entered into the function.  inside freq.py it asks for the string using raw_input().

the output is an array of length 26, where each element is the number of occurrences of the corresponding letter.

space complexity:
the only space used is the string of the alphabet, the 26-element array, and a few temporary variables.

time complexity:
time is probably O(n) because for each letter of the alphabet, I run str.count(sub), which runs through the whole string to find all occurrences of that letter.  This occurs 26 times so the time is approximately 26n, which is O(n).
