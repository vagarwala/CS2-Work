Forward Euler didn't end up very accurate; the orbiting satellite ended up getting gradually farther and farther from the center mass, and the displayed energy was not roughly constant (it kept slowly increasing to 0).

Backward Euler was also not very accurate; this time, the orbiting satellite ended up getting gradually closer and closer to the center mass, and the displayed energy kept decreasing (further from 0).

Symplectic Euler was the most accurate; energy fluctuated but stayed roughly around the same value.
