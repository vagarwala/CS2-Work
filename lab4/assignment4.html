<h1>CS2 Assignment 4: Dynamic Programming</h1>
<h2>Due Tuesday, January 31, 2017, at 17:00 PST</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is the CS2 assignment on dynamic programming. In particular, you
will be implementing algorithms for DNA alignment and seam carving.</p>

<p>When finished, please enclose your submission as a ZIP file named
<span class="code">cs2week4-[NAME].zip</span> or a tar.gz file named
<span class="code">cs2week4-[NAME].tar.gz</span>, and upload it to the
Week 4 assignment module on Moodle.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p><ul>
    <li>g++ 4.6.x+</li>
    <li>libsdl1.2-dev</li>
    <li>libsdl-gfx1.2-dev</li>
</ul>

Ask a TA if you need help retrieving these packages, or if these packages
appear to be missing from the CS cluster.</p>

<h2>Assignment (21 points)</h2>

<p>For this assignment you will be implementing the DNA alignment and
seam carving algorithms described below.</p>

<div class="hint">Write all of your source code in the provided files,
leaving the file structure intact. You submission should be your base
directory, zipped, with <i>all</i> source files included. You do not need to
include binaries or object files. As always, be sure that the code
you submit compiles! Makefile targets have been provided for you.</div>

<h3>Part -1: Warmup Question</h3>
<p><div class="points easy">1</div>
  Every set we will have a coding interview question for extra practice.
  (These were previously labeled warm-up problems.)
  You may code up a solution in Haskell, Python, and C++. There should
  be no collaboration on these problems, but you may ask the TA's for
  clarification. Please include directions for running your program and
  an explanation of time and space complexity for your algorithm. Please
  put your files in the warmup folder.</p>
<p>
<div class="hint">This is a good example of a software engineering
interview question. It might be worthwhile to check out...</div>
<p>Consider the following mapping of letters to numbers,</p>
<div class="code">
    a -> 1
    b -> 2
    c -> 3
    ...
    y -> 25
    z -> 26
</div>

<p>Now, with this mapping, we can map any string of letters to a number by
mapping to each number and concatenating. Here are a few examples </p>
<div class="code">
    abc -> 123
    cba -> 321
    zyx -> 262524
    ...
</div>

<p>Notice, however, some numbers don't ever get mapped to. For example, there
is no string that can map to the number <span class="code">100</span>.</p>

<h4> Your Task </h4>
Write a function that takes in a number <span class="code">X</span> and
returns <span class="code">true</span> if there is a string
<span class="code">S</span> that maps to
<span class="code">X</span> and returns <span class="code">false</span> if
there is no such string <span class="code">S</span>.
Here are some basic test cases,
<div class="code">
    f(123)  -> True
    f(321)  -> True
    f(1000) -> False
    f(100)  -> False
    f(10)   -> True
    f(1010) -> True
    f(3010) -> False
</div>

<p>Place your solution inside a folder called
<span class="code">warmup</span>.</p>

<h3>Part 1: DNA alignment</h3>

<p><b>The problem to solve:</b> Given two DNA sequences S and T, find an
alignment of S and T with the greatest possible "score." A DNA sequence
is a (non-empty) string consisting only of the characters A, C, T, and G.
(However, the program you write should be able to perform
comparisons between arbitrary strings.)</p>

<p>We can align sequences S and T by inserting gaps throughout the
sequences, including at their beginnings and ends, and then lining them
up. For example, if S is the sequence ACTGGCCGT and T is the sequence
TGACGTAA, one possible alignment is the following:</p>

<div class="code">
S:   ACTGGCCGT--    T:   --TGA-CGTAA
</div>

<p>The dashes indicate locations where a gap has been inserted. We can
compute the score for an alignment as follows.

<ul>
    <li>We define two negative integers called the gap score and the 
        mismatch score and also</li>
    <li>a positive integer called the match score.</li>
</ul>

For example, we could have a gap score of -5, a mismatch score of -1,
and a match score of 2. These values would, in the case of DNA, be
dependent on the chemistry of DNA as well as specifics about the
mechanisms by which DNA replication can produce errors.</p>

<p>To compute the score for a given alignment, we sum up the scores for
each position in the alignment. If at a given position, one sequence has
a gap and the other does not, then we use the gap score. If both
sequences have characters, but the characters are different, we use the
mismatch score. If both sequences have the same character, we use the
match score. We can describe the way the sequences fit together with an
instruction string which as a "|" for every match, a "*" for every
mismatch, and a "s" or "t" in every gap, indicating which string has a
character in the gap. For example, using the scores given above, the score
of the example alignment above is:</p>

<div class="code">
S:        A   C    T   G   G    C    C   G   T   -   -
T:        -   -    T   G   A    -    C   G   T   A   A
Score:    -5  -5   2   2   -1   -5   2   2   2   -5  -5
Inst:     s   s    |   |   *    s    |   |   |   t   t
Score for the alignment: -16
</div>

<p>This is not, however, the way to combine these two strings with the
highest score. Since we've set gaps to have such a high penalty, the best
score is this:</p>

<div class="code">
S:      A   C  T  G  G  C  C  G  T
T:      T   G  A  C  G  T  A  A
Score:  -1 -1 -1 -1  2 -1 -1 -1 -5
Inst:   *   *  *  *  |  *  *  *  s
Score for this alignment: -10
</div>

<p>This problem is not only relevant for DNA sequence alignment. It's
also useful in things like plagiarism detection... and quantifying how
similar the words "abracadabra" and "avada kedavra" are:</p>

<div class="code">
S:      abr aca dabra
T:      avada kedavra
Inst:   |**t|**t||*||
Score for this alignment: -3
</div>

<p><div class="points easy">3</div>Before you start typing, map out your
approach to this problem on paper. Think about the base cases; think about
how to break the problem into sub problems. Once you figure out how
recursion fits into the solution, it's fairly easy to see how memoization
can speed up the computation. Type your outline and save it as
<span class="code">dna/align_outline.txt</span>.</p>

<p><div class="points easy">5</div>Finish the TODO in the function
<span class="code">align</span>, found in <span class="code">dna/align.cpp</span>.
As input, align takes two strings <span class="code">s</span> and
<span class="code">t</span> and returns an <span class="code">align_result</span>
object, which contains the score of the best alignment and the instruction
string for how <span class="code">s</span> and <span class="code">t</span>
fit together. The function <span class="code">DNA_align</span> will take
this result and do printing for you. You'll notice that without
memoization the 'abracadabra' example takes a long(er than I want to wait)
time to run!</p>

<div class="quote">Compile this part of the assignment by running
<span class="code">make align</span> in the <span class="code">dna</span>
directory.</div>

<p><div class="points easy">3</div>Look up a couple of real-world DNA
sequences and align them. Put the aligned sequences, where they came
from, and a few words about what they are in a file called
<span class="code">dna/some_alignments.txt</span>. For instance you
could look at the
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/FLU.html">Influenza
Database</a>. <b>To receive full credit for this portion, you need to explain
why the comparison you have made is significant.</b></p>

<h3>Part 2: Seam carving</h3>

<p>Seam carving is a method for content aware image resizing. The idea
is to resize images by removing the lowest energy seams, or paths, from
the image.</p>

<p>For an arbitary image, we can compute a <span class="keyword">saliency
map</span>, which is a grayscale image derived from the color image; the
intensity of each pixel of the saliency map is a measure of how much
"energy" that pixel has in the context of the image. Lighter areas on the
saliency map correspond to higher energy areas of the original image, so
they have a higher cost than low-energy (darker) areas.</p>

<p>To determine the lowest-cost path, we create a cost matrix
from the saliency map. The first row of the cost matrix is simply the
first row of the saliency map (since there are no pixels above it). For
each subsequent row, we examine the pixel directly above, directly above
and one pixel to the left, and directly above and one pixel to the right
of the pixel we want to calculate cost for. Then, the value we should
store for that pixel is the minimum value of the three aforementioned
energies added to the energy of the pixel in question. For example,
suppose we have a saliency map that looks like this:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>We want to compute a cost matrix from the energy values given. For
the first row, we just copy the first row of the saliency map. How do
we compute the second row?</p>

<ol>
    <li>The first value on the second row of the saliency map is 2.
        There are only two pixels above the pixel we want to calculate
        for, since we are on an edge; the minimum of 5 and 6 is 5,
        so add 5 + 2 = 7.</li>
    <li>The second value on the second row of the saliency map is 9.
        There are three pixels above the pixel we want to calculate for;
        the minimum of 5, 6, and 1 is 1, so add 9 + 1 = 10.</li>
    <li>The third value on the second row of the saliency map is 0, and
        again, there are three pixels above the pixel we want to calculate
        for. The minimum of 6, 1, and 3 is 1, so add 0 + 1 = 1.</li>
    <li>The last value on the second row of the saliency map is 5; we
        are on an edge again, so there are only two pixels above the
        pixel we want to calculate for. The minimum of 1 and 3 is 1, so
        add 5 + 1 = 6.</li>
</ol>

<p>The final cost values are these:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that, for the third row, we must look at the previous row
of the cost matrix to get the value to add to the saliency for the
current pixel, since the row 2 in the cost matrix is different from
row 2 in the saliency map.</p>

<p>What happens when we get to the end? The seam ends on the minimum
cost pixel in the last row. From there, we can follow our cost matrix
up by choosing the minimum cost from the pixel directly above, directly
above and one pixel to the left, and directly above and one pixel
to the right. <b>Remember edge conditions. Corners only have two pixels
above and adjacent to them.</b></p>

<p><div class="points easy">4</div>Answer the following analysis questions in a file <span class="code">seamcarve/recursive.txt</span>.
<ol>
    <li>What part of the above algorithm uses dynamic programming?</li>
    <li>The seam-finding algorithm can be implemented recursively, without dynamic programming. Explain how.</li>
    <li>For an NxN image, what is the complexity of the recursive algorithm without dynamic programming? State the complexity in big-O notation, as a function of N.</li>
    <li>Using the recursive algorithm without dynamic programming, how long would it take to find a seam on a 50x50 image if 1 billion computations were made per second? State a reasonable lower bound. Hint: The answer should be huge.</li>
    <li>For an NxN image, what is the complexity of the algorithm using dynamic programming?</li>
    <li>Using the dynamic programming algorithm, how long would it take to find a seam on the same image as before (#4)?</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="points easy">5</div>Write the function
<span class="code">DoSeamCarve</span> in
<span class="code">seamcarve/src/SeamCarveAlgorithm.cpp</span> using dynamic
programming techniques. This function takes a saliency map (a
2-dimensional array of energies of individual pixels), the width of the saliency
map, and the height of the saliency map as parameters;
see the comments and function headers in the provided file for a more
detailed explanation of these inputs. The function should return the
x-coordinates of the seam, starting from the top of the image, in an array.</p>

<div class="quote">Compile this part of the assignment by running
<span class="code">make seamcarve</span> in the <span class="code">seamcarve</span>
directory.</div>

<p>If you want to create a 2-dimensional array for your seam carving
implementation (this may come in handy!), here is the proper way to do so:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint code">
// Define a width and height for your array
int w = WIDTH, h = HEIGHT;

// Allocate memory for the array
int **arr = new int*[w];
for (int i = 0; i < w; i++)
    arr[i] = new int[h];

// Now we can access whatever element we want!
arr[0][2] = 5;

// But when we're done, we have to deallocate
for (int i = 0; i < w; i++)
    delete[] arr[i];
delete[] arr;
</pre>

<p>To test your implementation with a GUI, run <span class="code">./bin/seamcarve images/SOME_IMAGE.bmp</span>, replacing <span class="code">SOME_IMAGE.bmp</span> with one of the images
provided in the <span class="code">images/</span> directory; you should test
with each of the three images. You can switch between image and energy views by
pressing "i" and "e", respectively; pressing "f" finds a seam with your function,
and pressing the space bar removes a seam. If your seam intersects many white
areas in the "energy" view, you may be doing something wrong.</p>

<h2>Notes and hints</h2>

As something between a hint and a test script, here are a good set of
short strings and their proper alignment instruction strings (with -5,
-1, 2 as the constants as mentioned above).

    <tr>
        <td>S</td>
        <td>T</td>
        <td>Inst</td>
    </tr>
